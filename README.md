# BockTok - A Full-Stack JavaScript Social Media App 
## By Rob Bock

This project — a full-stack social media app that I named "BockTok" in reference to another popular social media app — is the end result of a Udemy course I worked through in Spring of 2024, called Learn JavaScript: Full-Stack from Scratch, by instructor Brad Schiff. The course featured in-depth explanations of various JavaScript development topics from front-end to back-end, which I successfully utilized to create this custom and interactive social media web app.
